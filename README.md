# BumboEditoni

BumboEditoni is a work-in-progress open-source external tool made on Java/Kotlin to edit Minecraft worlds in 1.14 and up.

### It's an early prototype
While it's technically working and usable, it lacks even basic functionality at this moment. Basically, at this stage, this is a prototype.
Plans are to add functionality soon(tm), and this software was designed with the expansion capabilities in mind. Also, your contribution is welcome.
**This tool may potentially corrupt your worlds. Do backups before using this tool.**

### Supported versions
At this moment, only 1.14.X is supported. Hopefully, it will improve over time.

### Why is this a Java and Kotlin hybrid?
While Kotlin it better than pure Java in many ways, this is my portfolio project, and I have to show that I can code not just on Kotlin, but on pure Java as well.
