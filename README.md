# BumboEditoni

BumboEditoni is a work-in-progress* open-source external tool made on Kotlin to edit Minecraft worlds in 1.14 and up.

*It's VERY work-in-progress by 13 August 2020 

### It's an early prototype
While it's technically working and usable, it lacks even basic functionality at this moment. Basically, at this stage, this is a prototype.

Plans are to add functionality soon(tm), and this software was designed with the expansion capabilities in mind. Also, your contribution is welcome.

**This tool may potentially corrupt your worlds. Do backups before using this tool.**

### Supported versions
At this moment, only 1.14.X is supported. Hopefully, it will improve over time.
